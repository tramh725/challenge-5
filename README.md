# challenge-5
In this challenge, I used the lessons in week 5 to complete this assignment. I looked back on the lessons to figure out how to create the bar graphs, pie charts, scatterplot, and line regression as well. There were some challenges I came across during this exercise, some of those problems include how to filter out the dataframe from a specific row and a particular column, I learned how to use .isin() [1] and I also had some more help explaining the aggregate method [2]. Another issue I came across was the customization of the outlier. It appeared to be red in the result, in which is what I did not get from my result, I looked up the customization for it [3]. It did not give me the direct answer for it, though it guide me in the right direction. I noticed that 'gD' gave the outlier a green diamond, and 'rs' gave a red square, I then applied it by using 'rc' and it came back as an error, I then I tried 'ro' and it worked.
